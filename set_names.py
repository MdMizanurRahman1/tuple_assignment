#Write a program that asks the user to enter names until he/she enters an empty string.
# After each name is read the program either prints out New name or Existing name
# depending on whether the name was entered for the first time.
# Finally, the program lists out the input names one by one,
# one below another in any order. Use the set data structure to store the names.
